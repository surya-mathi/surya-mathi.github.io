Hi! I am Surya, and I am a third year PhD student in the MIT Theory group. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Vinod Vaikuntanathan](http://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/) and [Virginia Vassilevska Williams](http://people.csail.mit.edu/virgi/).

I am broadly interested in combinatorics, graph algorithms, fine-grained complexity and cryptography. 

Prior to this, I was an undergraduate at Caltech, where I had the pleasure to work with [Christopher Umans](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~umans/) and [Adam Sheffer](http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/ASheffer/).

In my free time, I enjoy [art](https://www.instagram.com/lilsu_tries_art/), dancing, and playing music.
